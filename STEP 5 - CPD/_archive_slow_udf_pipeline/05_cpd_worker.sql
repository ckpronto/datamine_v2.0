-- Change Point Detection Worker - Bulk UDF Architecture
-- TICKET-132 Part 2: Critical Worker SQL Redesign for Bulk UDF
-- 
-- Eliminates N+1 query pattern by using new detect_change_points_bulk UDF
-- Single database call per chunk instead of multiple individual UDF calls
-- Drastically simplified design for maximum performance and scalability

WITH
-- Call the bulk UDF once with the entire chunk list
change_points AS (
    SELECT * FROM detect_change_points_bulk(%(chunk_list)s::TEXT[])
),

-- Prepare candidate events with metadata
candidate_events_prep AS (

        -- Extract device_id from the returned device_date
        SPLIT_PART(device_date, '_', 1) as device_id,
        cp_timestamp as timestamp_start,
        -- Create 2-minute detection window after change point
        cp_timestamp + INTERVAL '2 minutes' as timestamp_end,
        0.85 as cpd_confidence_score,  -- Standard confidence for PELT algorithm
        'PELT' as detection_method,
        -- Raw data points not available in simplified bulk UDF - use placeholder
        0 as raw_data_points,
        -- Change point index not available with timestamp-based architecture
        NULL::INTEGER as change_point_index

-- Insert the set of results directly into the candidate table
